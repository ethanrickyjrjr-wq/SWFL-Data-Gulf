# Lab-first funnel landing: zip CTA -> seeded email lab + send-to-self OTP capture

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Status:** BUILT 07/03/2026 (same day, second session) — operator re-ruled the direction live mid-session ("MAP CLICK GOES TO EMAIL LAB WITH ZIP INFO LOADED IN") and handed this spec over. Everything in "What we're building" is implemented locally: zip-seed composer + lab seeding on all three arrival paths, map/rail clicks navigate to the lab, zip-report CTA is a plain link, SendToSelfModal + POST /api/lab/claim-and-send, /claim zero-item copy branch. Push held for operator review; `lab_first_funnel_landing_live_verify` remains operator-run post-deploy. NOTE for verify: homepage rail and the seed email cite DIFFERENT live listing tables (active_listings_residential_zip_stats vs listing_active_stats — e.g. 33914 shows 154 residential vs 1002 total actives); both real, scopes differ — one-root decision pending.
**Check:** `lab_first_funnel_landing_live_verify` (opened via new-build 07/03/2026).
**Sibling spec:** `2026-07-03-homepage-rebuild-design.md` — this build IS that spec's Phase 2 (fork 1b machinery) plus the operator's send-to-self capture, and it RESOLVES that spec's flagged cross-lane seam (see below).
**Research basis:** crawl4ai pulls 07/03/2026 — userpilot.com/blog/product-led-growth-examples (PLG 2.0: value on first touch BEFORE account creation, ~60s aha benchmark, "remove the work, not just the friction", activation = first successful output), amplitude.com/blog/time-to-value-drives-user-retention (early value → retention). Raw markdown in session scratchpad (`crawl4ai-labfirst/`), never committed. Supabase OTP surface NOT re-crawled: the exact calls (`signInWithOtp` code-mode + `verifyOtp type:"email"`) are proven live in-repo at `app/login/login-form.tsx` — in-repo working code beats docs memory.

## Problem

The zip-report page's "Open your project →" CTA (promoted to the organic path 07/02) POSTs `/api/prospect/open-project`, which mints an **empty** claim token and lands the visitor on `/claim` — a sign-in wall whose copy was written for the Claude-handoff flow. A homepage visitor two clicks in reads: "Naples 34120 — Sign in to bring over 0 items you assembled with your AI." Operator hit this live 07/03 ("what the fuck is this"). The gate demands sign-in before showing any value — the exact inverse of the PLG 2.0 finding (value on first touch, before account creation).

## Goal (operator's words, 07/03)

"Land in the lab set up like the webpage layout that they can play with and then send to themselves in an email — so we get email and user gets to the lab to see what it can really do."

Concretely: anonymous visitor clicks the zip-report (or homepage map) CTA → the email lab opens **already holding a finished, branded-lookalike email built from that ZIP's live figures** → they poke it, restyle it, ask the AI to change it → the primary action is **"Send this to yourself"** → inline email + OTP code → the send lands in their inbox, we hold a verified email + a real account + a project containing a doc they shaped. Activation event = capture event = first successful output, one gesture.

## Forks taken while operator AFK (review these first)

1. **Capture mechanic = inline email + OTP code in the lab** (recommended). Reuses the exact two client calls from `app/login/login-form.tsx` (`signInWithOtp` with `shouldCreateUser: true` + `verifyOtp {type:"email"}`) restyled in a modal — verified email, real user, no redirect off the canvas, no new auth machinery, no anonymous-send abuse surface. Rejected: bare email field with a claim link (unverified, no account, an anonymous endpoint that mails AI-authored content anywhere = abuse surface); Send → `/login?next=` bounce (leaves the canvas at the emotional peak).
2. **The zip-report CTA becomes a plain link** to `/email-lab?zip=<zip>` (+ `ref` passthrough). No claim token is minted at arrival — the token's whole job (surviving a login redirect) is obsolete when auth happens inline at send time. `/api/prospect/open-project` stays live for `/welcome` funnel arrivals (they carry scraped brand, which the claim token handles well); it just loses its zip-report caller.

## Cross-lane seam — RESOLVED

`2026-07-03-homepage-rebuild-design.md` "Out of scope" flags: Lane C's zip-report CTA rides the `OpenProjectCta`/claim bridge while Lane B's map door seeds a deterministic doc via `lib/email/zip-seed.ts` — "same intent, two mechanisms, pin at plan time." **Pinned by this spec:** the lab-first mechanism wins everywhere anonymous. The claim bridge stops being an organic front door and remains only for `/welcome` email arrivals (brand-carrying) and the Claude MCP handoff (item-carrying) — the two flows it was actually designed for.

## What we're building

### 1. Entry points → `/email-lab?zip=`

- `app/r/zip-report/[zip]/page.tsx` build-bridge banner: replace `<OpenProjectCta zip={zip} />` with a styled `<Link href={`/email-lab?zip=${zip}${ref ? `&ref=${ref}` : ""}`}>`. Banner copy keeps its promise and the next screen now honors it. `components/prospect/OpenProjectCta.tsx` keeps its `/welcome` caller — do not delete.
- Homepage rail primary door already targets `/email-lab?zip=` (Phase 1, in flight in a parallel session — param currently accepted and ignored). This build makes the param real; no homepage file edits needed here. Coordinate at plan time if Phase 1 hasn't landed.
- `ref` (outreach attribution, `REF_RE`-validated) rides the query string and is recorded at project creation (step 4) instead of via the claim token.

### 2. The seeded doc — `lib/email/zip-seed.ts` (fork 1b's composer, built here)

- `buildZipSeedDoc(zip): Promise<EmailDoc | null>` — deterministic, code-composed (no LLM): place name header, headline figures (home value, listings/DOM, flood) from the SAME live loaders the ZIP page uses (zip-summary root, `zhvi_zip_latest`, `active_listings_residential_zip_stats`, NFIP agg), short deterministic prose, sources listed, as-of date MM/DD/YYYY stated once. Reference rendering: the 07/03 mock artifact (real 33914 pulls).
- Out-of-scope/unknown ZIP → `null` → caller falls back to today's `SEED_DOCS[0]` default (empty-tolerant, no error page, no invented place — the moat gate).
- Cacheable per ZIP per day; drive-by clicks and bots cost ~$0. AI enters only when the visitor edits — that's the taste moment.

### 3. Lab accepts the seed

- `app/email-lab/page.tsx`: read `searchParams.zip` (5-digit validated). Anonymous → pass to `EmailLabClient`, which awaits `buildZipSeedDoc` server-side (page is already `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`; seed built in the server component, passed as prop — the client never fetches).
- Signed-in: `labDestination()` and `AutoCreateProject` carry `?zip=` through their redirects (they drop query params today); the project Email tab seeds the same doc as a new draft with the project's brand. (Fork 1b's signed-in path, unchanged from the sibling spec.)

### 4. Send-to-self capture — the new piece

- `components/email-lab/SendToSelfModal.tsx`: two steps mirroring `login-form.tsx` exactly — email → `signInWithOtp({ email, options: { shouldCreateUser: true } })`; code (6–10 digits, never hardcode 6) → `verifyOtp({ email, token, type: "email" })`. No `emailRedirectTo` needed — nothing redirects.
- Anonymous `EmailLabShell` header grows a primary CTA **"Send this to yourself"** (present only when `onSave` is absent, i.e. the anonymous shell; signed-in surfaces keep their existing Send/Schedule).
- On verify success (session cookie now set):
  `POST /api/lab/claim-and-send` `{ doc, zip?, ref? }` (authed route, RLS session):
  1. Create project (name via `deriveProjectName(zip)` when present, else doc title), persist the doc as its deliverable — reusing the same persistence path the project Email tab's save uses.
  2. Record `ref` attribution the same way `/api/claim`'s winner block does (best-effort, never blocks).
  3. Fire ONE send to `user.email` only — through the existing deliverable send machinery (same renderer the blast route uses), free-tier watermark applied, CAN-SPAM footer from the standard shell. Recipient is hard-pinned server-side to the session user's email — the client never supplies an address.
  4. Return `{ projectId }`; modal closes into a signed-in state: "Sent — check your inbox," with the lab now their workspace (client hard-navigates to the project email surface, doc intact, same convention as `ClaimOnLogin`'s reload-to-reread-session).
- Send failure after account creation: project is already saved; surface "saved to your project — send failed, retry from there." The doc is never lost; the capture already succeeded.
- Abuse posture: the only email ever sent goes to the address that just proved OTP possession. Supabase's OTP rate limits gate the modal; the send endpoint requires an authed session. No new anonymous send surface exists.

### 5. `/claim` copy branch (rides along — the band-aid ships regardless)

- `app/claim/page.tsx`: `peek.itemCount === 0` → seeded-project copy, both states: logged-out "Sign in to open your {title} project — seeded and ready to style and send." / logged-in "Opening your {title} project…". Non-zero counts keep today's copy. `/welcome` arrivals stop seeing "0 items you assembled with your AI."

## Not building (YAGNI)

- No change to `/welcome`, the outreach engine, or the MCP handoff flow.
- No brand scraping on the organic path (zip-report visitors carry no brand; the project starts unbranded — Brand panel is part of the playground).
- No anonymous persistence (localStorage drafts, resume links). Leave = doc gone, same as today.
- No weekly-read enrollment bundled into send-to-self (one gesture, one promise; the weekly-read subscribe box stays separate on the zip-report page).
- `weekly_read_signups` stays dead (sibling spec, fork-2 obsolete).

## Error handling

- Lake loader failure during seed build → `null` → default doc (never a blank/500 lab).
- OTP send/verify errors → inline message, same copy patterns as login-form; "use a different email" resets.
- `claim-and-send` is idempotent-safe on double-click: disable-on-pending, and project creation happens once per POST (no retry loop that could double-create; a retry after failure creates a fresh project — acceptable, they own both).
- Invalid `ref` silently dropped (mirror `open-project`'s posture).

## Testing

- `bun test`: `zip-seed.test.ts` (known ZIP → doc with figures/sources/as-of once; unknown/out-of-scope → null; loader failure → null), `claim-and-send` route test (mocked auth + db: creates project, pins recipient to session email, ref recorded, send failure still returns saved project), `/claim` zero-item copy branch.
- `bunx next build` (never bare `npx tsc`) before commit.
- `lab_first_funnel_landing_live_verify` is **operator-run** post-deploy: zip-report CTA → lab opens with that ZIP's live figures and zero LLM spend logged → edit works → Send to yourself → code → email lands (watermarked, CAN-SPAM footer) → lab is now the signed-in project with the doc intact → `/claim` via a `/welcome` link shows the new zero-item copy.

## Out of scope

Conversational takeover arc in the lab (deferred since 06/19 spec), `/z/[zip]` 307 retirement + hero-search retarget (sibling spec Phase 2 item — plan-time coordinate), Stripe/paywall mechanics (send-to-self is free-tier), weekly-read engine (Lane D, live), any homepage file edits (Phase 1 session owns them).

## Push discipline

Touches the live claim path's front door and auth-adjacent surfaces → RULE 1 diff review before push. Build + test locally, show the diff, operator pushes.
